# Neural PRT Field

This project leverages the neural network to compress the precomputed radiance field of an object, which enables efficient rendering (5 FPS of python version) of high resolution (1920 * 1080) PRT rendering so far.

Since this project is still under development, so we do not open source the code until we produce satisfactory results.

We only show some temporary results here.

## Scene: Brass

This is a temporary result rendering using our neural prt field. This is a compressed video with loss of quality, the original video is of resolution 2048*2048.

## Scene: kitchen

This is also a temporary result rendering using our neural prt field. This is a compressed video with loss of quality, the original video is of resolution 1920*1080.
